To be updated with a description for a collaborative semester long project

## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests in what we might describe as digital or streaming cultures (think everything from e-sports to streaming television and film platforms). You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

- Nick C.
- Jason M.
- Ethan R.
- Kohta S.
- Yosef S.
